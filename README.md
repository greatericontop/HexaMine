# HexaMine

Hexagon minesweeper game.

## Play

The play is similar to normal Minesweeper. Your goal is to uncover the entire board without hitting any of the mines.

You begin by clicking any tile (which will always be safe). Then, you have to use the clues in order to uncover the rest of the tiles.

A number in a tile denotes how many mines are in the 6 other tiles around it. You have to use this information to deduce whether nearby tiles are mines or not.

You can left click an unknown tile to uncover it, or right click it to flag it as a mine. You can also left click a tile to automatically uncover the tiles around it if you've flagged everything. (This is known as chording, and you can read more [here](http://www.minesweeper.info/wiki/Chord).)

The number in the top-left corner is the number of mines that are left, and there is a timer in the top-right corner.
